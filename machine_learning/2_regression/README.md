## Week 1: Simple Linear Regression

**- Notes: Since the minimum of a function is derivative = 0**

**+ Approach 1: closed form solution (normal equation): set the gradient (vector of derivative) = 0 and solve the equation, immediately converge at the local minimum.**

**+ Approach 2: gradient descent: while not converged (derivative &lt; epsilon), update the coefficient w to go descent and converge at the local minimum**

Aside: The python notation x.xxe+yy means x.xx * 10^(yy). e.g 100 = 10^2 = 1*10^2 = 1e2
